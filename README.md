TO-DO:
==============================
- change name to tomato_blocks
- create / upload to git as project
- delete / change all of the extra files
- put a reference to them in the README.md
- documentation
  - Sphinx?
- Testing
- create installer for pip
- Adjust timer to have the remaining time on a separate line
- Make timer display the time block (11:00 --> 11:50)



Issues:
==============================
- If the program is still running from the night before but the computer isn't on when the first time block starts, then the program tries to start from that time block.

- Program cannot start in the middle of a time block, it has to wait for the schedule to hit the hour




Future Features:
==============================
- Allow for easier one-off timers
- Grid feature for time elapsed / remaining
- Give option to choose the icons or characters for progress bar
